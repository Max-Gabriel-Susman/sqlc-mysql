# sqlc-tutorial

An exercise I peformed to familiarize myself with the use of sqlc to generate golang from mysql

!!! I never got around to getting app.go to work in my environment because I never setup an instance 
of mysql for it to talk to. However it should work with minimal effort. I got what I wanted from the exercise 
and I may come back if I need a stronger understanding of sqlc for work outside of bp-permissions-service

the guide for the exercise is found @ https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/tutorials/getting-started-mysql.html
